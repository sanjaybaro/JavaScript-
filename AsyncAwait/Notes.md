1. Await working:
its basically convert async code into sync manner so that 
it behave likes sync code but actually its async
 wait is taken care here 

2. Doesnot block the main execution thread

3. async keyword:
async keyword will be use on front of function , which makes 
it a async function. which eventually return a promise

-By default the promise will already resolve inside async fnc.
-whatever return from async function it will give us the
result for the prmosise or that particular async fnc.

4. Error Handling in async function-
if we want to reject promise we can use the below keyword
it is done by throw new Error keyword

5. what await actually do-
a. it actually returns the result of promise.
b. it actually wait the prmoise response then after coming
the response it will return the result as a value.
